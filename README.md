# UnixTime

Being able to read your watch is overrated.

## What it does

UnixTime is a watch app, that when run, displays the time in one of three modes:

- Unix timestamp
- JavaScript date timestamp
- Modern Apple epoch (2001)

It's meant to be ran as a watch face. Is it useful? No.

Force Touch to switch modes.
